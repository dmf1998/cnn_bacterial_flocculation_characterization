# CNN Classification of Bacterial Flocculation

## Abstract
Over the course of the last decade, machine learning (ML) has proven an excep- tional method in labelling and classifying a broad spectrum of images. We apply a novel ML approach to the characterisation of images of bacterial aggregation in wastewater treatment (WWT) via the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN). WWT is one of the most important biotechnological processes in the world. This phase of WWT, however, uses outdated biological and microscopic quality assessment methods, which have been challenged by the complex nature of the physics and biology of the system. In this project, we develop an effective prototype model that by far exceeds our pre-set specifications of 60% accuracy for proof of concept by consistently delivering >70% test accuracy. The success of this experiment will further our understanding of the science behind bacterial aggregation and may prove revolutionary in modernising global WWT process control.
